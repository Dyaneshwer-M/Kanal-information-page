          <p class=lead>Chicago’s cruel winter, at -3 degrees Celsius, it was a khadi jacket that kept Kamal Haasan warm. To be precise, a jacket from KH House of Khaddar, his just-launched designer label. Now, khaddar has taken over his wardrobe.

          “Khaddar needs no introduction. It’s woven into the fabric of the nation. We cling on to the thread and climb,” says Kamal at the           virtual press conference to launch the website for House of Khaddar in India. “We are proud to launch our business on Republic           Day,” he says, adding, “Let’s hope khadi will do better than burgers in India.”</p>
